# EventScheduler

## Overview
Flutter application designed to help you seamlessly manage your events. With a user-friendly interface and powerful functionality,
The Flutter Event Scheduler app is a robust tool designed for efficient event management. It allows users to:

- **Select and View Dates**: Choose a specific date to see and manage events.
- **Add Events**: Schedule new events on selected dates.
- **Edit Events**: Modify existing events.
- **Delete Events**: Remove events from the schedule.
- **Receive Notifications**: Get alerts for upcoming events.
- **Persist Data**: Store events locally using a SQLite database.

The app leverages Flutter's rich UI capabilities, `sqflite` for local database management, `flutter_local_notifications` for scheduling notifications, and `Provider` for effective state management. This combination ensures a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Features

- **Select Date**: Users can choose a specific date from a date picker to view and manage events.
- **Add Events**: Easily add new events with titles, descriptions, and notification times.
- **Edit Events**: Update event details as needed.
- **Delete Events**: Remove events from the schedule with a simple swipe or delete option.
- **Persistent Storage**: Events are saved locally using the `sqflite` package, ensuring data is retained across app restarts.
- **Notifications**: Schedule and receive notifications for events using `flutter_local_notifications`.
- **Current Date Display**: The app defaults to showing the current date when first opened, making it easy to get started.
